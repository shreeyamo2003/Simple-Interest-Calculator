# Simple Interest Calculator

I've designed a web page that serves as a Simple Interest Calculator, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. Using HTML and CSS, I've crafted an intuitive interface where users can input key financial details, including the principal amount, rate of interest, and the duration in years. Leveraging JavaScript, the calculations are seamlessly handled, providing dynamic results.

Upon submitting the input data, my back-end logic takes over to process the information. It computes the final amount after interest and determines the specific year of repayment. This meticulous integration of front-end and back-end technologies ensures a smooth and efficient user experience. I'm proud of the functionality and user-friendliness that my Simple Interest Calculator brings to the table.
